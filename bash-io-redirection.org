#+TITLE: bash io redirection

基于文件描述符的 I/O 重定向：
#+begin_example
  M>N
    # "M" is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not explicitly set.
    # "N" is a filename.
    # File descriptor "M" is redirect to file "N."
  M>&N
    # "M" is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not set.
    # "N" is another file descriptor.
#+end_example

顺序问题：
#+begin_quote
Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example, the command

ls > dirlist 2>&1

directs both standard output (file descriptor 1) and standard error (file descriptor 2) to the file dirlist, while the command

ls 2>&1 > dirlist

directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the *standard error was made a copy of the standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist*.
#+end_quote
