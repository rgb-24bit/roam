在实际的测试用例中，常常存在依赖前置数据或条件的情况，而 test fixtures 就是指将这样的前置依赖固定下来，使得测试用例可以重复执行。

#+begin_quote
The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. Some people call this the test context.

Examples of fixtures:
+ Loading a database with a specific, known set of data
+ Erasing a hard disk and installing a known clean operating system installation
+ Copying a specific known set of files
+ Preparation of input data and set-up/creation of fake or mock objects
