* In-Memory Databases
  The most common way to force an SQLite database to exist purely in memory is to open the database using the special filename ":memory:".
  #+begin_src c
    rc = sqlite3_open(":memory:", &db);
  #+end_src

  The database ceases to exist as soon as the database connection is closed. Every :memory: database is distinct from every other.
  So, _opening two database connections each with the filename ":memory:" will create two independent in-memory databases_.

  However, the same in-memory database can be opened by two or more database connections as follows:
  #+begin_src c
    rc = sqlite3_open("file::memory:?cache=shared", &db);
  #+end_src
